> Discord Rich Presence (and other features) without having Discord on!

# Why?

I occasionally run memory intensive applications on my computer. Unfortunately, I often can't run Discord simultaneously
with these application without the risk of running out of memory. However, I still want my friends to be aware of what 
I'm currently doing or playing. Since I have a second computer it *would* be theoretically possible to redirect or proxy
all the requests sent to the IPC socket to my computer. I tried looking online to see if someone has already implemented
something akin to this project, but, alas, I've found none. Due to this, I decided to develop my own.

# Prerequisites

* A second computer capable of running a Discord client (not the website).
